Reversed Binary
===============

A simple command line program to get the reversed binary decimal of a given number.

For example, say our input is 13 (1101), its reversed binary decimal equivalent is 11 (1011)

To build the project, you can run the following command from the root directory.
    xcodebuild -project reversebinary.xcodeproj
    
Cheers !
